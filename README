libusb and some unix modules bindings were made with the help of Stewart Greenhill's H2O tool.
i2c.Mod code is based on i2c-tiny-usb author, Tim Harbaum's C example.
this code shows how to work with ds1621 temperature sensor and hmc6352 compass via i2c-tiny-usb interface in Oberon (oo2c)
sonar.Mod is a test module to work with custom made range finder.

compile with oo2c Oberon compiler.

known bugs:
this code was developed and tested on GNU+Linux/amd64 (Gentoo). Later, I've tested it on Nokia N810 and N900 and found out that on Maemo/ARMv7 and ARMv6 there is a different output caused by wrong division results in ds1621.Mod.
Further investigation revealed that oo2c REAL division does not work well on ARM, and it is caused by gcc compilers < 4.6, without VFP support.
That's why in order to get ds1621 module to work it is necessary to replace division (/) by the shift. Floating point test code for oo2c is available under float_test directory.
